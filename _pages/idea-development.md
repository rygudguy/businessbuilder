<h3>You have an idea - so what?</h3>
The number one thing that seperates entrepreneurs from average people is actually taking their ideas and making them work in the market. Everyone has ideas of how products or services they use everyday could be improved. We’ve all had the discussion of how a popular company should change feature A or service X. The key to success is determining those things that people really care about and providing a solution that they are willing to pay for. So how do we do that?
<h3><b>Pain Points </b></h3>
The best products are those that not only make life better, they serve a core need that is lacking in a customer’s life. The customer may not even recognize it themselves, or know how to concisely describe it.

An example is when automobiles were first invented. Customers already had horses and wagons, but had grown to the limits of animal transportation. Heavy loads required large teams, and there was a limit to how fast a horse could run. In addition, animals are smelly and leave yucky stuff on the roads that must be avoided. Vehicles solved all of these pain points. They were cleaner, more powerful, faster, and more comfortable. Thus, a new industry was born.
<h3><b>Vision </b></h3>
Automobiles didn’t start out as the sleek, powerful machines we are accustomed to seeing, they were noisy, unreliable clunkers that were the source of mockery by horse enthusiasts of the day. A common adage states that if customers were to be asked what they wanted, the response would be a faster horse. It took innovation and looking at the situation in a different way to create the amazing technology that we see on the roads today. An entrepreneur looks for the core needs, not simply customer feedback on an issue.

Many people may not have understood why there needed to be a change. Early adopters of the car probably didn’t see where they would lead to, but they saw something in society that needed to change. It was risky to invest money into machines, but as the the issues were ironed out, automobiles quickly replaced horses as their strengths became apparent. It took a lot of vision to accomplish, but look at the great things we have today because of those early entrepreneurs.
<h3><b>Teamwork </b></h3>
Nobody solves a problem on their own. It takes communication to know the true extent of the situation, and a variety of viewpoints to make great solutions happen. There’s a reason why business conferences exist - to share ideas, products and solutions. As a person, you will be an expert in one area, but will need a holistic approach to make change happen. You will need to partner with others who have strengths where you are weak. Even large companies don’t go about it on their own. They team up with other organizations to produce superior products. They order from others who specialize in the niche components that form pieces of the whole product. In essence, you aren’t creating a product yourself, you are filling a need with the help of a specialized group of experts.
<h3><b>Tenacity</b></h3>
Most importantly, don’t give up. What we often view as failure is actually the process of deduction. We start with a general idea of what we want and if we stick to it, the best solution comes after a lot of trial and error. Be creative and flexible and willing to change course as needed. Really great products don’t happen the first time around, they are molded and shaped from clunky initial attempts into a well-tuned solution. Don’t be worried if your final outcome is much different than your first ideas - that’s part of the process.
